This project is still under construction.

Aim:
We are developing a free and professional bible software for Windows, Linux and Mac.
The Bibles are based on the Xml format called OpenBibleXml.
There are GPL and restricted Bible files.

Features: Bible browser, Text editor, flexible search and much more.
Also a webapp will be available.

Due to license issues there will be a number of propriety books.

Please consider contributing.
